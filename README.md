## Install instructions

First, create a virtualenv at the root of the project. 
I assume you know how to download/clone the repository.

```
cd /project/path/SMSenger-Bridge
virtualenv .
```

Activate the virtualenv
```
./Scripts/activate
```

Install the requirements using pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
